**Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Persistent Service Issues and Dissatisfactory Customer Service Experience – Account Number: [Your Account Number]**

Dear [Telecommunications Company Name] Customer Relations,

I am writing to express my profound disappointment and escalating frustration with the persistent issues I have been experiencing with your telecommunications services, and more specifically, with the consistently inadequate and often infuriating customer service I have received in attempting to resolve these problems. My overall satisfaction level with [Telecommunications Company Name] has plummeted to an all-time low, a stark contrast to the initial positive impression I had when I first became a customer on [Date you became a customer].

For the past [Number] months, I have been plagued by a series of ongoing problems with my [Specify the product/service, e.g., internet, mobile, TV] service. Specifically, my broadband internet connection has been incredibly unreliable. I frequently experience significant speed drops, rendering activities like video conferencing for my work – a crucial part of my daily routine – virtually impossible. I’ve attached screenshots of speed tests conducted at various times throughout the day, clearly showing speeds far below the [Advertised Speed] Mbps I am subscribed to. This inconsistency is not a minor inconvenience; it directly impacts my ability to perform my professional duties and, consequently, my income.

Adding to the internet issues, my home phone service has also been plagued by intermittent crackling and dropped calls. This began around [Month/Year] and has worsened over time. It’s incredibly frustrating to be in the middle of an important conversation, only to have it abruptly cut off or distorted to the point of incomprehensibility.

My primary pain point, however, lies with the customer service I have received. My attempts to rectify these issues have been met with a cascade of frustrating experiences, characterized by:

**Lengthy Hold Times and Unresolved Issues:** On average, I have spent over [Estimate of total hours] hours on hold across multiple calls to your customer service line. For instance, on [Date of a specific call], I waited for [Specific number of minutes] minutes before speaking with a representative named [If you remember the name, otherwise state "a representative"]. While they were polite, they were unable to diagnose the issue and simply scheduled a technician visit.

**Ineffective Technician Visits:** I have had [Number] technician visits to my home to address the internet and phone problems. The first technician on [Date of first technician visit] spent approximately 45 minutes, replaced a modem, and assured me the problem was resolved. However, within 24 hours, the issues resurfaced. The second technician on [Date of second technician visit] seemed less knowledgeable and spent most of his time looking at the external wiring, ultimately concluding that there was “no problem” with the connection to my house, which contradicted the persistent issues I was demonstrating. The third technician on [Date of third technician visit] was equally ineffective and suggested the problem might be with my internal wiring, something I find dubious given the history of service outages. Each visit has been a significant disruption to my schedule, requiring me to take time off work, with no tangible improvement in service.

**Repetitive Information Gathering and Lack of Account Continuity:** During each call, I am forced to recount the entire history of my issues, the steps already taken, and the results of previous technician visits. It appears that customer service representatives do not have access to detailed notes from previous interactions or that the information is not being effectively transferred. For example, on [Date of a particularly frustrating call], I spoke with a representative who had no record of my previous technician appointments or the extensive troubleshooting steps I had already taken. I had to explain the problem from scratch, which was incredibly demoralizing.

**Misinformation and Unfulfilled Promises:** On more than one occasion, representatives have provided conflicting information. For instance, after the second technician visit, I was told by a phone-based representative that a “line refresh” had been performed remotely, which would supposedly fix the issues. This did not happen. Similarly, I was promised a call back from a supervisor on [Date of unfulfilled callback promise] regarding escalations, but this call never materialized.

Despite these significant frustrations, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge a few positive aspects of my experience, however fleeting. The initial installation of the service by [Telecommunications Company Name] was relatively smooth. Additionally, on [Date of a positive interaction], I spoke with a representative named [If you remember the name] who was exceptionally patient and apologetic, and while they couldn't solve the problem, they at least listened attentively and offered a genuine apology, which was a welcome change from the usual robotic responses.

Looking ahead, I have several suggestions and feature requests that I believe would significantly improve the customer experience with [Telecommunications Company Name]:

1.  **Enhanced Technician Training and Equipment:** Invest in more comprehensive training for your field technicians, ensuring they are equipped with advanced diagnostic tools and problem-solving skills to accurately identify and resolve complex network issues.
2.  **Improved Customer Service Knowledge Base and Record Keeping:** Implement a robust system that allows customer service representatives to access detailed histories of each customer's interactions, including technician notes and previous troubleshooting steps. This would prevent the need for repetitive explanations and streamline the resolution process.
3.  **Proactive Issue Detection and Resolution:** Develop a more proactive approach to identifying and addressing network problems before they significantly impact customers. Perhaps a system that flags recurring connectivity issues for specific areas.
4.  **Clear Escalation Procedures and Accountability:** Establish clear escalation paths within your customer service department and ensure accountability for resolving escalated issues. The lack of promised callbacks is unacceptable.
5.  **Faster Resolution of Recurring Issues:** For persistent problems that cannot be resolved quickly, consider offering temporary service credits or discounts, or exploring equipment upgrades that might be more suitable for the customer's needs.

Frankly, my experience with [Telecommunications Company Name] has been far below the standards I expect from a leading telecommunications provider. I have also had service with [Competitor Company Name] in the past, and while no service is perfect, their customer support was generally more efficient and their technicians seemed better equipped to handle technical issues. The contrast is quite stark.

I am seeking a resolution to these ongoing service issues. I request a thorough investigation into the root cause of my internet and phone problems and a commitment to resolving them permanently. Furthermore, I expect a tangible demonstration of [Telecommunications Company Name]’s commitment to customer satisfaction, perhaps in the form of a significant credit on my next bill to compensate for the prolonged period of inadequate service and the considerable inconvenience caused.

I trust that you will take this complaint seriously and investigate these matters thoroughly. I look forward to a prompt response outlining the steps you will take to rectify these issues and improve my overall experience with [Telecommunications Company Name].

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
