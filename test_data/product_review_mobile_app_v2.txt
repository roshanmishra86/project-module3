### 5. Feature Utilization Analysis

**5.1 High Utilization Features:**

*   **Personalized Recommendations Carousel:** 72% of active users interact with this feature on every session. Conversion rate from recommendations is 25% higher than general browsing.
*   **Streamlined Checkout Process:** The "One-Click Reorder" option, enabled by saved payment and address, is used by 65% of returning users. Average checkout time for these users has decreased by 30%.
*   **Real-Time Driver Tracking:** 90% of users actively track their drivers post-order placement. The visual accuracy and responsiveness of the map view are highly appreciated.
*   **Loyalty Points Program:** 60% of active users have actively viewed their loyalty point balance. 15% of completed orders have been placed using accumulated loyalty points.

*   *Analysis:* The features designed for enhanced personalization and convenience are proving to be highly successful. Users are actively engaging with these elements, leading to improved conversion and retention.

**5.2 Underutilized Features:**

*   **"Dietary Filter" (Vegan, Gluten-Free, etc.):** Only 18% of users utilize this filter.
    *   *Analysis:* The UX team suspects the discoverability of this feature might be an issue, or the current implementation isn't robust enough (e.g., limited restaurant data). User feedback suggests the filter is not always accurate.
*   **"Group Ordering" Feature:** Utilization is at a mere 8%.
    *   *Analysis:* This feature was a significant development effort, and its low adoption is concerning. Initial user interviews suggest the process of inviting participants and managing contributions is perceived as cumbersome.
*   **"Curated Collections" (e.g., "Best Brunch Spots," "Late Night Cravings"):** 30% of users browse these collections, but only 10% of orders originate from them.
    *   *Analysis:* While browsing occurs, the conversion to order is low. This might indicate that the collections are not compelling enough or don't align with immediate user needs.

*   *Analysis:* The underutilization of key features presents an opportunity for improvement. Targeted UX research and iterative design changes are needed to boost engagement and ROI on these features.

| :---------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| **Personalization**           | High (AI-driven recommendations) | Medium (Basic order history) | High (Curated meals) | Medium (Limited history) |
| **Checkout Speed**            | Very High (One-click reorder) | High (Saved info) | Medium (Multiple steps) | High (Guest checkout) |
| **Driver Tracking**           | Very High (Real-time, visual) | High (Basic map) | Medium (No real-time) | High (GPS based) |
| **Dietary Filters**           | Medium (Limited data, discoverability issues) | High (Extensive options) | Low (Basic tags) | Medium (Some options) |
| **Group Ordering**            | Low (Cumbersome UI) | High (Intuitive interface) | Medium (Basic splitting) | High (Integrated payments) |
| **Loyalty Program**           | High (Points, tiered rewards) | Medium (Simple points) | High (Exclusive deals) | Low (No formal program) |
| **App Load Time**             | Fast (2.8s)     | Medium (3.5s) | Slow (4.0s)  | Fast (2.9s)  |
| **Crash Rate**                | Moderate (0.22%) | Low (0.08%)  | High (0.35%) | Low (0.12%)  |

*   *Analysis:* [App Name] v2.0 holds its own in personalization and checkout speed, areas where we've made significant strides. However, Competitor A and B excel in dietary filtering and group ordering respectively. Our crash rate, while improving from v1.9, is still higher than key competitors like Competitor A and C. We need to prioritize stability to compete effectively.
