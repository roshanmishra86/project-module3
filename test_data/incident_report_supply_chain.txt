### 2. Impact Assessment

The supply chain disruption had significant, albeit manageable, impacts across various business functions:

**Customers:**

*   **Delayed Shipments:** An estimated 1,500 customer orders for the [Product Line Name] were directly impacted by production delays.
*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** A survey conducted in July 2023 indicated a 15% increase in negative customer feedback related to delivery times for this product line during the incident period. While no major contracts were terminated, several smaller customers expressed frustration and indicated they would explore alternative suppliers for future needs.
*   **Lost Sales Opportunities:** For new potential clients who required immediate delivery, we were unable to fulfill their requests, potentially leading to lost sales.

**Revenue:**

*   **Direct Revenue Loss:** Estimated direct revenue loss due to delayed shipments and inability to fulfill new orders is approximately **$1.2 million**. This figure is based on the value of unfulfilled orders during the disruption period.
*   **Increased Expedited Shipping Costs:** We incurred an additional **$50,000** in expedited shipping costs to receive the emergency component order and to attempt to mitigate some of the delivery delays to our most critical customers.
*   **Potential Future Revenue Impact:** The dip in customer satisfaction and perceived reliability could lead to a longer-term erosion of market share, estimated at 1-2% in the next fiscal year if not proactively addressed.

**Operations:**

*   **Production Halt:** Production of the [Product Line Name] was completely halted for approximately 10 working days.
*   **Idle Workforce:** Approximately 150 production staff were temporarily idle or reassigned to other tasks, resulting in an estimated **$100,000** in idle labor costs.
*   **Inventory Management Issues:** The disruption led to an imbalance in our inventory of other components for the [Product Line Name], requiring adjustments in production scheduling once Component X became available.
*   **Increased Overtime:** To clear the backlog and return to normal production schedules, significant overtime was required in the weeks following the incident, incurring an estimated **$75,000** in additional labor costs.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

The primary root cause of this supply chain disruption was identified as **over-reliance on a single, sole-source supplier for a critical component (Component X) without adequate mitigation strategies for supplier-specific risks.**

Further contributing factors include:

*   **Lack of Robust Supplier Risk Assessment:** A formal, comprehensive risk assessment of Global Electronics Inc.'s operational stability and contingency plans was not consistently performed or updated.
*   **Insufficient Safety Stock:** The company maintained a just-in-time (JIT) inventory for Component X, with minimal safety stock beyond the standard 2-week supply. This left no buffer for unexpected supplier production interruptions.
*   **Limited Visibility into Supplier's Operational Health:** While we had a good working relationship with Global Electronics Inc., we lacked deep visibility into their internal production processes, equipment maintenance schedules, and disaster recovery plans.
*   **Unforeseen Equipment Failure:** The specific event – a critical equipment failure at Global Electronics Inc. – was genuinely unexpected and beyond their immediate control. However, our dependency amplified its impact.
